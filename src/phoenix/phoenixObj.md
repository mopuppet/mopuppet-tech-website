# Phoenix

This guide covers exploit education's phoenix machine. The purpose of this guide is to provide the user with an understanding of ARM64 bit assembly language rather than solving the challenges in the most obvious way possible. 

As the guide is currently, you should already have a **very basic** understanding of gdb and assembly whether that be x86, ARM32 etc. As time goes on I will seek to expand the guide to include information on basic assembly and gdb.

**I am also learning ARM64 as this guide is written, I will make mistakes or assumptions which are wrong. Please reach out and inform me of any errors.**
